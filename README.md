# ArtificerMod
This is the GitHub repository for my tModLoader (Terraria) mod 'Artificer's Accessories', a content mod which introduces a new class, the Artificer, and over 100 accessories to the game.

## Players: 
If you play through Steam, you should subscribe to this mod on the Steam Workshop. Otherwise, you can make your own clone of this repository and build it yourself if you have a GitHub account. If you encounter a bug you wish to report, I strongly prefer it be posted here via. the Issues system

## Modders:
While I (BlockCrusader) am not accepting direct content contributions to the mod, PRs for bug fixes, localization, and polishing code are welcomed and appreciated. Also, this repository is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license. In short, you’re free to copy code from the repository if you’d like, but if you want to publish any work you did with it, that project will have to use the same license. See the LICENSE file for the entirety of the terms and conditions, etc. 
If you plan on contributing on GitHub, be aware that I personally make little usage of it; primarily out of inexperience, but also because I am the sole developer of my mods - which are passion projects - and thus have little need of version control at the moment. This repository exsists primarilly as an extra way for people to access the mod. Expect little development from myself, aside from the occasional, large push that gets this repository up to date with a new update. I know this isn't very professional - my apologies - but I am still capable of managing PRs and Issue posts.
