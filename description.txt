Artificer's Accessories is a content mod that adds in many new accessories (105!) as well as a new class to the game. 

Introducing: The Artificer
- This class is designed as a 'neutral' class; its boosts are generic and even-split between the other classes
- To make the class unique, Artificers have low raw power, but their set bonuses grant extra accessory slots!
- Utilize these extra slots to maximize your build-play and flexibility
- Furthermore, Artificers also specialize in a new type of accessory added by this mod...

Meet the Ability Accessories
- 50 of the 105 new accessories in this mod are special 'Ability Accessories'
- Most lack the passive effects you'd expect of an accessory
- Instead, they can trigger powerful special effects with the press of a hotkey
- Rapidly restore life! Shoot giant lasers! Rocket jump! These are just a few possibilities
- To balance their power, Ability Accessories share a cooldown that dictates the frequency of their use
- Artificers get the most out of these accessories, as Artificer set bonuses disable a universal cooldown penalty, and some even decrease the time further!

Other additions
- The new class and ability accessories is nice and all, but don't forget that Artificer's Accessories still has something for everyone; The 55 other accessories added by this mod don't have ability mechanics and are thus open for all classes and players to enjoy and experiment with.
- Also, this mod introduces alternative ways to obtain some commonly-used accessories, such as Hermes Boots, the Shiny Red Balloon, and more!
- A few config options for mostly client-side effects
